        <h2>Jacob Schick</h2>
        <p>Jacob Schick, Warrior Relations Specialist with the Brain Performance Institute’s Warrior Training Team, is a third generation Marine who epitomizes service and sacrifice.</p>
        <p>After a triple-stacked tank mine detonated below his vehicle in Al Anbar Province, Iraq in 2004, Jake suffered compound fractures in his left leg and left arm; multiple skin, ligament and bone losses; varying burns; partial loss of his left hand and arm; amputation below the knee of his right leg, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>
        <p>Jake has undergone 46 operations, 23 blood transfusions, and countless hours of rehabilitation. Jake will tell you his physical injuries weren’t the worst that happened to him. For years he dreaded his TBI and PTSD diagnosis; a common mindset among warriors. After being encouraged by a fellow warrior to train his brain the way he re-trained his body, Jake skeptically participated in the Brain Performance Institute’s high performance brain training, called SMART. He credits this opportunity with making him a better husband, father and man.</p>
        <p>Since participating in the SMART program, Jake has become a staunch advocate for maximizing the cognitive potential in people from all walks of life and shares his story and the effects of being severely wounded at public speaking engagements throughout the country.</p>
        <p>A passionate and fearless leader whose quick wit and stories of intestinal fortitude have a profound impact on everyone he meets, Jake has appeared on James Gandolfini’s HBO special “Alive Day Memories: Home from Iraq,” as well as “60 Minute Sports” and various other local and national venues. Jake will also play a small role in the upcoming Clint Eastwood production of “American Sniper.” You can read Jake’s Open Letter To Warriors and his eloquent wisdom on resilience in Psychology Today.</p>
        <p>Jake’s passion lies in helping his fellow warriors regain their drive and determination and enhance their cognitive performance in his role as a Warrior Training Specialist at the Center for Brain Health and Brain Performance Institute.</p>

        <h2>David Vobora</h2>
        <h3>Trainer</h3>
        <p>Retired NFL Linebacker, David Vobora,specializes in human performance training. Owner of Performance Vault and founder of the Adaptive Training Foundation, David works with athletes of all types – professional, Olympic, collegiate, tactical forces and adaptive athletes.</p>
        <p>Vobora has learned that elite training and adaptive training coincide really well as they build a community together and galvanize unity.</p>
        <p>Through his work with Travis Mill’s, retired United States Army Staff Sergeant and quadruple amputee, David found a passion to offer adaptive performance training to individuals who have suffered life-altering injuries. He recognized a void in the process. A person gets injured, they are treated at the hospital, go through rehabilitation, but where do they go to continue their recovery while defining the recalibrated-self? ATF fills the void.</p>
        <p>David’s personal and professional experience marked by both adversity and achievement combined with his Psychology degree equips him with the ability to reach any client and understand how to inspire and motivate them. David believes that training is a direct metaphor for the spiritual journey of life – one is never at any destination but always seeking to find a higher version of oneself. Vobora is known for taking his athlete to a vulnerable place first and gaining their trust and building a partnership. It is only once that bond is formed can breakthroughs happen. He loves to challenge his athletes to dream big and help them to realize that they can attain those goals.</p>
        <p>As a starting linebacker in the NFL, David Vobora has had the opportunity to train in some of the nation’s most elite training facilities. David has customized the equipment in his gym allowing him to modify exercises for all of his athletes.Vobora believes in minimizing risks and maximizing results always keeping in mind the diminishing effects of traditional resistance training.David fuses that which would normally be categorized as rehab or correctional exercises into his training program to formulate a comprehensive program to reach each athlete in the most efficient and effective way.</p>
        <p>David Vobora passionately believes in the mission of ATF – to restore hope through movement to those with physical impairment by creating opportunities for adaptive athletes to train and compete. Vobora radiates a relentless spirit and indomitable optimism in all he endeavors. His immense work ethic and enthusiasm for life are contagious and every athlete who enters his gym responds to that energy. David is married to Sarah Vobora and they have one daughter and are expecting their second daughter in late Spring.</p>

        <h2>Madi Jacob</h2>
        <h3>Director of Operation</h3>
        <p>Madi Jacob found her passion for serving others at an early age.  Born and raised in south Louisiana, she was raised in small community eager to help one another, and attended summer camp throughout her childhood with her mother, who was staff nurse at the Louisiana Lions Camp for Crippled Children. There she spent many summers learning what it takes to care for children with varying physical and mental disabilities and in her teenage and collegiate years chose to continue her service to this wonderful cause. Through this experience she was inspired to pursue a Bachelor’s Degree in the field of Health and Exercise Science at Northwestern State University while being involved in various campus ministries and organizations. After graduation from NSU she earned her state and national certification in Athletic Training and has spent the past 15 years working in this field.  Madi also earned a Master’s Degree in Biblical Studies from Dallas Theological Seminary. She has been married to Andy Jacob for over 11 years and they have two beautiful children.</p>
        <p>Over the course of her life,Madi has worked with many non-profits including Special Olympics, Camp Barnabas and Joni Eareckson Tada’s ministry – Joni and Friends.  She helped launch Just Say YES!- a non-profit geared toward helping teens succeed by educating them through speakers and curriculum.  Madi has worked at The Covenant School in Dallas for the past eight years.  Her time at Covenant further exposed her to opportunities with the Advancement and Development departments helping raise funds for student financial assistance through grant writing and event planning.  Most recently Madi has served as the Athletics Coordinator at The Covenant School and played an integral part in handling game schedules, personnel decisions, website design, financial development and accounting for the department.</p>
        <p>As Director of Operations, Madi feels at home working with Adaptive Training Foundation.  Her wide range of experience makes her uniquely suited to lead the foundation with a passion and drive towards helping adaptive athletes realize and attain their full potential.</p>

        <h2>David Vobora</h2>
        <h3>Founder / CEO</h3>
        <p>David Vobora is a 5 year veteran of the NFL.  He was “Mr. Irrelevant” (the last pick) in the 2008 NFL Draft.  Rather than being discouraged, he relished the opportunity to prove doubters wrong – just as he had as an Idaho Vandal standout football player for 4 years.  Vobora radiates a relentless spirit and indomitable optimism.  He has an immense work ethic and strategic insights into personal and professional performance refined by both adversity and achievement.</p>
        <p>Upon retiring from the NFL David opened Performance Vault,a for-profit gym that offers individual and customized performance training to elite athletes. David met Travis Mills in January of 2014.  Travis Mills is a retired United States Army Staff Sergeant and quadruple amputee.  The two began working out together and the unique challenges that Travis’ injuries posed in the gym ignited a passion for David to offer adaptive performance training to individuals who have suffered life-altering injuries.</p>
        <p>Through David’s exposure to Travis and many other critically injured veterans, he recognized a void in the process.  A person gets injured, they are treated at the hospital, go through rehabilitation, but where do they go to continue their recovery while defining the recalibrated-self?</p>
        <p>ATF fills this void.  Adaptive Training Foundation was established to restore hope through movement to those with physical impairment by creating opportunities for adaptive athletes to train and compete.  ATF is not rehab.  ATF is designed to provide quality, individual and customized training that will help each athlete create a sustainable lifestyle change.</p>
        <p>David never allowed payment for training from the adaptive athletes he served over the next six months. In September 2014, the Adaptive Training Foundation became 501(c)3 tax exempt to allow outside support for these ambitious participants.  The program now offers a 9-week intensive training to restore, recalibrate and redeploy these athletes to inspire others to achieve the impossible.</p>

        <h2>Madi Jacob</h2>
        <h3>Athletic Trainer</h3>
        <p>Madi Jacob joins the ATF team of trainers with a great passion to serve and brings a wide range of experience and knowledge to the program.  Madi is a state and nationally certified Athletic Trainer and has spent the last 15 years working in this field.  She received her Bachelor’s degree in Health and Exercise Science from Northwestern State University and a Master’s degree in Biblical Studies from Dallas Theological Seminary.  She has worked for schools, hospitals, and clinics in both TX and LA and has extensive knowledge and experience in biomechanics and strength training.</p>
        <p>From a very young age Madi and her family spent their summers serving at a camp for children with disabilities.  She has years of experience working with varying physical and mental disabilities and considers this a passion in her life to serve this demographic.  Although Madiis fascinated by the human body and enjoys working with athletes to recover from injury, it is connecting with their heart and seeing a positive change from within that motivates her to continue her work.  Madiis often found in the gym adding humor to the environment while challenging the athletes to push a little harder because she knows that the human will inside is much stronger than we sometimes allow ourselves to believe.</p>
        <h4>What excites you about the mission of ATF?</h4>
        <p>“I LOVE the prospect of hope . . . Our mission is restore hope through movement to those with physical impairment.  There are so many people who lose hope after they are injured.  They feel like they cannot dream anymore or that their dreams will never become reality.  At ATF, we challenge our adaptive athletes to dream big and then we make a way for them to achieve their dreams.  It’s a beautiful thing to watch them live out their dreams and to help restore hope in their life!”</p>
        <h4>What is the most challenging aspect for you as a trainer at the ATF gym?</h4>
        <p>“Even though the athletes in our gym have sustained significant injuries and many are missing limbs and/or have spinal cord injuries, each one has the ability to make huge strength gains in the gym. The most challenging thing for me is the part I enjoy the most – how do I modify each activity to fit the specific adaptive need of each athlete?  Every day is a new challenge and no two athletes are the same – they each have individual adaptive needs.  These challenges force me to really understand how the body works while being creative and think outside the box on how to get accomplish the goals that are set.”</p>
